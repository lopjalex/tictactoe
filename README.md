<h1>Tic-Tac-Toe with the Minimax Algorithm </h1>

<h2> What is Minimax?</h2>
  
"Minimax is a kind of backtracking algorithm that is used in decision making and game theory to find the optimal move for a player, assuming that your opponent also plays optimally" (GeeksforGeeks).

In minimax there is a maximizer and minimizer. The maximizer tries to get the highest score possible while the minimizer tries to get the lowest score possible.


<h2> Game Tree Example </h2>
  
Let’s say it’s X’s turn and X plays a particular move
